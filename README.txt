  "Rebound Shooter: Resurgence" is an arcade-like space shooter.
  The player in this game controls a ship and shield, and defends themselves from alien spaceships.
  The shield is capable of collect and protect the ship from bullets fired by the alien spaceships.
  The collected bullets can later be refired offensively.
