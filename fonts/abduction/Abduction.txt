"Abduction" is the eighth new free font from DarkSide Productions.
It was completed on 06/14/98 and is a conditionally* FREE font!
Version 2.0 was completed on 12/01/98. See below for a description
of the changes/additions to the font in version 2.0.

*Conditionally free means free for everyone, for either personal or
commercial use. The only stipulation: If you plan to include this font
on a disk or CD, as part of any software, collection or library,
whether on diskette medium or digitally on the web, for distribution
to the public on either a "for profit" or "not for profit" basis,
permission must be obtained in writing from the author and copyright
holder, who is specifically identified as:

R. Gast
5818 Prophet's Rock Rd.
W. Lafayette, IN 47906
e-mail: darkside7@earthlink.net

It may be distributed as a free font as long as this text file
(AbductionV2.txt) is included with it. "If it's free," you ask,
"why keep this file with the font?"

Here's the reason: Maybe, just maybe, you'll make a fortune using this
font in some manner. And if you do, all I ask is that you remember me
with a token of your appreciation. Any modest amount (at least $1 and
not to exceed $1,000,000) would be an appropriate gesture for my
contribution to your monumental financial success. Hey! I can dream!

The character set includes:

Letters are all CAPS, upper and lower case, plus numbers.
Several characters of punctuation. Many international characters.

Version 2.0 adds many international characters as well as making many
of the lower case letters different from the upper case ones.

Oh, yeah....I almost forgot. If (for some unknown reason) you really
do want to make a donation to encourage me to continue my creative
efforts, send it to the address above. (Yeah....As If!) Thanks & Enjoy!
